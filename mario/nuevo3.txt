Create a mainmethod, and complete the following steps in the main
method:
a. Declare two variables of type MyPointand called startand
end. Assign both of these variables a new MyPointobject.
b. Set the xand yvalues of startto 10. Set the xvalue of endto
20 and the yvalue to 30.
c. Print out both point variables. Use code similar to:
System.out.println("Start point is " + start);
d. To make sure that you are using the MyPointclass correctly,
you might want to compile and run TestMyPointnow (see
“Task 2 – Compiling the TestMyPointClass” and “Task 3 –
Running the TestMyPointProgram”). If you do so, the output
will look something like the following:
Start point is [10,10]
End point is [20,30]
e. Declare a new variable of type MyPointand call it stray.
Assign straythe reference value of the existing variable end.
f. Print out strayand end.

g. Assign new values to the x(such as 47) and y(such as 50)
members of the variable stray.
h. Print out stray, end, and start.
